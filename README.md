# NextJS Web3 Template

GM, this is a template to get started fast when doing web3 dapp.
I'm tailoring it to my needs and will keep adding what's always necessary and other basic components to make our life easier.

Use it if you feel like it. Open issues if there is ugly stuff because I'm not a web master. Make PR if you're someone with a big heart.

## What's in it for now

- Usage of NextJS new app dir. It's in beta and experimental but it's cool, so we're being adventurous.
- TailwindCSS with multiple themes support and theme variables to make our life easier like `bg-primary` instead of `bg-white dark:bg-black`
- RainbowKit + Wagmi for wallet connect and blockchain interactions.
- statically typed env so we fail early. (thx t3 stack)
